### PLEASE READ #######
# Hi! This program was created by Elton Dias for educational and experimental purposes only. Use with caution. DO NOT USE AS GAMBLING ADVICE!!!
# 
# The program creates a file that the results will be saved to. Click load a file a select the text file only if you have ran a previous prediction before. The more previous data there is, 
# the more accurate your prediction will become. Accurate stat input is crucial to the prediction as any misentered data will greatly effect your accuracy.
# 
# Next, enter a players name followed by their stats. (inputs go by their last 5 games written on the same line. ex. (15 3 2 5 3)).
# 
# Hit predict. You get returned a 1st prediction every time. A "2nd prediction"(literally named it that I'm sorry) only appears if you loaded a previous file with a player you inputted before.
# The 2nd prediction becomes more accurate with more data inputted. The AI prediction is a formula I requested an AI return. The AI prediction appears every time but on 1st player input, it will
# be identical to the main prediction. Returns a true prediction if both the 1st and 2nd predictions are present. This model ONLY SAVES THE 1ST PREDICTION. After gaames/study cases are played and
# actual outcomes are known, return and load up that file. Click on update and enter the actual player's outcomes. This ensures that the model can adjust predictions for the next time.
#
#
# From past data this model hits at a target of 66% accuracy. With more inputs, the 2nd and AI predictions become more accurate over time. The 1st predicition is solemnly based off the initial user
# inputs. Injuries, hot performing out of the blue games, and player emotional factors all come into a factor. Analyze each game and see if the model was incorrect or something happened in a game 
# that the model can't account for.
